# What is This Project?

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API that manages character records. It demonstrates:

- How to build a REST API with Spring Boot
- How to connect to a PostgreSQL database using JPA
- How to structure a Spring Boot application with layers (Controller, Service, Repository)
- How to handle HTTP requests and responses
- How to perform database operations

**CRUD:**

- **Create**: Add new character
- **Read**: Retrieve existing character
- **Update**: Modify existing character
- **Delete**: Remove character

### Java - [Spring ORM with JPA and Hibernate](https://medium.com/@burakkocakeu/jpa-hibernate-and-spring-data-jpa-efa71feb82ac)

- We are using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to deal with databases. This is a technique that allows us to interact with a relational database using object-oriented programming principles.
- JPA (Jakarta Persistence, formerly Java Persistence API) is a specification that defines ORM standards in Java. It provides an abstraction layer for ORM frameworks to make concrete implementations.
- Hibernate: Hibernate is a popular ORM framework that implements JPA. It simplifies database operations by mapping Java objects to database tables and handling queries efficiently.
- Spring ORM allows seamless integration of Hibernate and JPA, making database interactions more manageable and reducing boilerplate code.

### Key Dependencies

**spring-boot-starter-data-jpa**: Provides Spring Data JPA for simplified database access through repositories and automatic query generation.

**spring-boot-starter-webmvc**: Provides Spring Web MVC for building REST APIs with annotations like `@RestController`, `@GetMapping`, etc.

**postgresql**: JDBC driver to connect to PostgreSQL database.

**lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code by generating getters, setters, constructors, and other methods at compile time.
